CURRENT TODO LIST FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CRUMPET GAME ENGINE

x -> complete
- -> depreciated / not doing
? -> in development

***URGENT FIX NEEDED***
[ ] Memory leak in rendering pipeline

**TODO**
[ ] Comment the code
[ ] Fix entity / sprite resizing
[x] Add sprite methods to entity
[x] Remove member initialization lists from Sprite and Entity, use Vec2* instead
[ ] Logger class
    [ ] Maybe use preprocessor statements
    [ ] Time and other useful logging methods
    [ ] Empty constructor, instance method
[x] Rect class to extend SDL_Rect and add conversion capabilitys, colision and intersection to it
    [x] Camera class to use Rect* instead of SLD_Rect*
    [x] Add and subtract (+ -) operators to add rectangles and subtract them together
    [x] Equal and not equal (!= ==) operators to return true / flase if the rectangles match
    [x] ToString function for easy logging
    [x] Setposition and translate methods
    [x] Intersects, contains methods 
    [x] x,y,w,h properties
    [x] Switch other classes to use this instead of SDL_Rect* and make sure to update the render pipeline
    [x] Center point
        [-] Maybe a point class - used Vec2*
[x] Game camera class and redo rendering pipeline
    [?] Add rotation and flipping for entities and sprites
    [x] Camera class
    [x] Make the camera class control the rendering of the active scene
    [x] Game coordinate system
    [x] Render to GameWorld coordinates instead of screen coordinates
    [-] Each entity and sprite should store a reference to Camera
    [ ] Fix zoom in the camera
    [ ] Objects that are off the screen, do not get rendered
[ ] GameWorld class with coordinate system
    [?] Switch between camera modes on GameWorld
    [ ] Multiple scenes stored as levels
    [ ] UI and HUD (maybe later tho)
[ ] Framerate
    [ ] Cap framerate
    [ ] Calculate framerate
